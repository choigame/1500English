I live in a two-storey terraced house with my family which is located in the city centre./ on the outskirts of the city (vùng ngoại ô tpho).<br>\
<br>\
2. What do you like about living there?<br>\
I like that most of the rooms face south, which means we get a lot of natural light. And the location is very convenient as all the facilities and services are within walking distance, which means I can easily grab anything I need in just a few minutes.<br>\
<br>\
3. What is your favorite room?<br>\
I would say that it's the living room because it's the most spacious room in the house, with a comfy sofa and a big, round table where we eat dinner every night. That's the room where the whole family gathers together and shares ups and downs in our lives.<br>\

There are three advantages of tourism for local people and the environment.\
 First of all, tourism can bring in money for local people because tourists often buy souvenirs when they travel to another country.\
  Secondly, tourism can create more job opportunities for people so they will have more money. Finally, it can educate tourists about the environment so they can protect it better.<br>\
However, there are also three disadvantages of tourism.\
 Firstly, new hotels and resorts can destroy the living of endangered species. Secondly, tourism can create traffic jams because many people come to visit the country.\
  Lastly, tourism can increase food prices for local people because shops are designed for tourists"

Last year, on the occasion of my 16th birthday, my mother gave me a very precious gift, which is an iPhone 6s. I have used it both in study and entertainment every day.<br>\
My smartphone is considered as one of my modern educational tools. Only with the phone connected to the Internet, I can access and surf webs to broaden my knowledge. For example, when there are lessons that I don't understand in class, I can use it to search for lectures and videos online, which is really helpful.<br>\
Moreover, I can download a lot of games or books, music, movies and they are free. As a result, after tiring lessons, this will be a good way to relieve stress and get back my energy. For instance, when I do the housework with my mother, I regularly listen to my favorite songs. In addition, it helps me to keep in touch with my family and my friends. When I want to make contact with my classmates, I can text messages or make video calls and we can easily see each other's faces.<br>\
In short, my phone has offered me a range of great benefits in my daily life. If I didn't have it, it would be difficult for me to contact my near and dear friends and family members.<br>\
