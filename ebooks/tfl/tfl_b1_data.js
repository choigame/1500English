Sonia was very well dressed. She had on a jacket and a long, dark blue skirt. She was also wearing a yellow blouse. She wasn't carrying a bag, but she did have a small wallet with her. Oh, and I remember she had nice gold earrings. I also remember her shoes. She was wearing black shoes with very high heels.<br>\

Brian was very casually dressed. He was wearing some really old jeans—you know, the ones with holes in them—with a new wide leather belt and a white T-shirt. He had on some boots, high brown ones. They looked really nice. He also had a red scarf. He usually wears a couple of big rings, but he wasn't wearing any at the party. He was wearing an interesting silver watch, though.<br>\

Kevin was wearing a yellow shirt and a green tie. I didn't like the tie, but I liked the shirt. He also had on brown pants. He was wearing sneakers with long white socks—kind of cute, actually. And he had a leather bag over one shoulder.<br>\

Brian ăn mặc rất giản dị. Anh ấy mặc một chiếc quần jean rất cũ—bạn biết đấy, loại có lỗ thủng—với một chiếc thắt lưng da bản rộng mới và một chiếc áo phông trắng. Anh ấy đi một đôi bốt cao màu nâu. Chúng trông thực sự đẹp. Anh ấy cũng có một chiếc khăn quàng cổ màu đỏ. Anh ấy thường đeo một vài chiếc nhẫn lớn, nhưng anh ấy không đeo chiếc nào trong bữa tiệc. Tuy nhiên, anh ấy đeo một chiếc đồng hồ bạc khá thú vị.<br>\
3.<br>\
Kevin mặc một chiếc áo sơ mi màu vàng và cà vạt màu xanh lá cây. Tôi không thích chiếc cà vạt, nhưng tôi thích chiếc áo sơ mi. Anh ấy cũng mặc quần nâu. Anh ấy đi giày thể thao với tất dài màu trắng—thực ra thì khá dễ thương. Và anh ấy đeo một chiếc túi da trên một vai.<br>\

Bà Graham trông thực sự ổn. Bà mặc một chiếc váy dài màu đỏ thú vị và một chiếc áo khoác vàng và đen tuyệt đẹp. Bà đeo một số đôi bông tai đáng yêu và một chiếc vòng cổ đẹp. Bà cũng đeo một chiếc khăn dài màu hồng trên một vai. Bà không có túi. Bà đi dép xăng đan."

The distance to school. It's too far away. It takes me an hour to drive there every day.<br>\
Wow. That must be awful!<br>\
It is, but the schools that are near me are not as good.<br>\
3<br>\
How is your new job going, Anna?<br>\
Good, thanks. I really like it.<br>\
What do you like best about it?<br>\
I think it's the people I work with. They are so nice.<br>\
People make all the difference in a job, don't they?<br>\
They sure do. The only trouble is, I have to travel a lot. I'm away from home for about two weeks every month.<br>\
Yeah, that can be difficult.<br>\
It is. I hope I won't have to travel so much next year.<br>\
4<br>\
Do you enjoy being a salesperson, Nancy?<br>\
Yes, I do like it. I get to meet so many people.<br>\
Is it hard work?<br>\
Yes, it can be. I don't like the long hours. I'm always really tired when I get home at night.<br>\
That's too bad. Why don't you quit?<br>\
Because I think my boss is great to work for.<br>\
5<br>\
How long have you been working in a restaurant, Martin?<br>\
For more than five years.<br>\
Wow. You must really enjoy it.<br>\
Oh no, I don't enjoy it at all! It's hard work and pretty tiring, too. I'm on my feet all night.<br>\
Oh, I see.<br>\
But the tips are great. I really should find a better job soon, though."

Vậy Bill, anh thấy công việc của anh thế nào?<br>\
Ồ, lúc đầu thì ổn, nhưng giờ, sau hai năm, tôi không thích nữa.<br>\
Ồ, tại sao thế?<br>\
Chán quá. Tôi làm cùng một việc mỗi ngày. Tôi thực sự phát ngán với nó.<br>\
Vậy sao anh không đổi việc?<br>\
Tôi được trả lương cao. Tôi thích tiền!<br>\
Ồ, tôi hiểu rồi. Nhưng anh nên nghỉ việc nếu anh không vui.<br>\
Ừ, có lẽ tôi nên nghỉ.<br>\
2<br>\
Christine, anh có thích dạy trẻ em không?<br>\
Ồ, có chứ! Tôi thích làm việc với trẻ em. Chúng rất vui.<br>\
Ồ, tôi đoán là anh có công việc hoàn hảo!<br>\
Ồ, tôi rất thích công việc đó. Chỉ có một điều tôi không thích.<br>\
Cái gì thế?<br>\
Khoảng cách đến trường. Quá xa. Tôi phải mất một giờ lái xe đến đó mỗi ngày.<br>\
Ôi trời. Chắc là tệ lắm!<br>\
Đúng là vậy, nhưng những trường học gần tôi thì không tốt bằng.<br>\
3<br>\
Công việc mới của bạn thế nào rồi, Anna?<br>\
Tốt, cảm ơn bạn. Tôi thực sự thích công việc đó.<br>\
Bạn thích nhất điều gì ở công việc đó?<br>\
Tôi nghĩ đó là những người tôi làm việc cùng. Họ rất tốt.<br>\
Con người tạo nên sự khác biệt trong công việc, đúng không?<br>\
Họ thực sự tốt. Vấn đề duy nhất là tôi phải đi công tác rất nhiều. Tôi xa nhà khoảng hai tuần mỗi tháng.<br>\
Đúng vậy, điều đó có thể khó khăn.<br>\
Đúng vậy. Tôi hy vọng năm sau tôi sẽ không phải đi công tác nhiều như vậy.<br>\
4<br>\
Bạn có thích làm nhân viên bán hàng không, Nancy?<br>\
Có, tôi thích. Tôi được gặp rất nhiều người.<br>\
Công việc này có vất vả không?<br>\
Có, có thể. Tôi không thích giờ làm việc dài. Tôi luôn rất mệt mỏi khi về nhà vào ban đêm.<br>\
Thật tệ. Tại sao bạn không nghỉ việc?<br>\
Bởi vì tôi nghĩ sếp của tôi là người tuyệt vời để làm việc cùng.<br>\
5<br>\
Martin, bạn đã làm việc trong nhà hàng bao lâu rồi?<br>\
Hơn năm năm rồi.<br>\
Ồ. Bạn hẳn phải thích lắm.<br>\
Ồ không, tôi không thích chút nào! Công việc này vất vả và cũng khá mệt mỏi. Tôi phải đứng suốt đêm.<br>\
Ồ, tôi hiểu rồi.<br>\
Nhưng tiền boa thì tuyệt. Nhưng thực ra tôi nên sớm tìm một công việc tốt hơn."
